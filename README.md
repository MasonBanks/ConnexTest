# ConnexOne - Tech Test

## Introduction - The Objective

In this test, we are given the task to create a simple single-page application in React which displays data from the XKCD API:
https://xkcd.com/json.html

We must implement Redux (https://redux.js.org/) to manage our state in the application, and ESLint (https://eslint.org/) to identify any errors in our code.

---

### Additional Dependencies

This project also uses:

- Axios (to make calls to the API)
- Material-UI (for UI framework)
- Redux Thunk (to allow asynchronous changes to our state)

---

## Requirements

This project requires the following to be installed:

- npm

or
